# The Best Way to Avoid CAPTCHA While Scraping in 2025 and Rotating APIs and Proxies

CAPTCHAs are more sophisticated in 2025, but with the right techniques, you can bypass them while scraping and rotating APIs and proxies. Here's how:

## 1. Use High-Quality Residential Proxies
**Why it works**: Residential proxies use real IP addresses, making your requests appear more like genuine users.  
**Providers**: Luminati (Bright Data), GeoSurf, Smartproxy.

## 2. Implement Dynamic VPN Rotation
**Why it works**: Regularly rotating VPN IPs reduces the chances of triggering CAPTCHAs.  
**Set Up**: Use VPN services like NordVPN or ExpressVPN with API integration to change IPs every minute.

## 3. Use CAPTCHA Solvers
**Why it works**: CAPTCHA solvers, either human or AI-based, can automatically bypass CAPTCHAs when they occur.  
**Services**: 2Captcha, Anti-Captcha, DeathByCaptcha.

By combining **residential proxies**, **VPN rotation**, and **CAPTCHA solvers**, you can effectively avoid detection while scraping in 2025.
